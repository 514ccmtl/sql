## Description
This circuluum was created for the University of Toronto's Data Science Institute. 

## Course Contacts
- Instructor: Emails to me can be sent to [twillrose@proton.me](mailto:twillrose@pm.me)

## Learning Outcomes
1. Develop a better understanding of the structure of databases.
2. Save and transport data in CSV and JSON file formats.
3. Familiarity with the essentials of querying and manipulating data in SQL and how to search for future questions.
4. Familiarity with the legal framework around sharing data.
5. Analyze data requirements and work with different stakeholders such as analysts and managers.

## Design
The workshop will be held over two weeks, three days a week. Two of the three days will be 2-hours long and the last day will be 3-hours. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.

## Expectations
The course is designed for both live-coding and corresponding slides. Students should follow along with the coding, interact with the study marterial [SQL for Data Scientists by Renee Teate](https://sqlfordatascientists.com/), and think about the broader data landscape. Students are encouraged to ask questions throughout. 

## Policies
TBD

## Schedule
Day 1: Introduction, SELECT, FROM, and WHERE

Day 2: JOINs, Aggregation Functions, CASE WHEN

Day 3: Temporary Tables, CTEs, OVER, PARTITION BY, RANK, NTILE, Datetime Functions

Day 4: String Manipulation, ROLLUP, UNION, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CROSS & Self Joins

Day 5: Normal Forms, CSVs, JSON, Views

Day 6: Broader Data Landscape, Ethics, Professional Practice, SQL in the wild, SQL in R & python
