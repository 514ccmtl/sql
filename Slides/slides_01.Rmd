.pull-left[
- Fell into SQL in my first job out of undergraduate in 2013
- Worked as a Data Analyst in US Healthcare until emigrated to Canada in 2018
  - Challenging data
  - Easy to see impact of good queries
  - I was pretty naive about data, probably lucky I didn't break anything `r structure("\U1F937", class = "emoji")`
- Worked as a Data Engineer as Plan Canada managing a CRM Data Warehouse backend
- Went back to UofT to do my Master of Information
  - Wanted to do less SQL, more R and python
  - SQL seemed like it was on its way out...NOPE, I was just wrong
- Currently doing Data Ethics implementation at Thomson Reuters
- My dog's name is Alto, and she's pretty wonderful

### What is SQL?

- SQL: Structured Query Language.
  - Pronounced as either S.Q.L. (ess-cue-ell) or “sequel”.
- SQL is a _query_ language rather than a programming language
  - Code is often less reproducible than programming languages because it's domain specific
  - Querying 
- Designed to manage data within Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs), e.g.
  - MSSQL
  - Oracle DB
  - MySQL/MariaDB
  - PostgreSQL

# SQL

### SQL Formatting

- Like other programming/query languages, SQL has reserved keywords/commands to perform instructional operations 
  - Generally, these keywords are written in all caps: `SELECT`
  - Most modern interpreters no longer require this, but it is the expected standard
- Similarly, all statements/queries should be ended with a semicolon
  - A few SQL constructs (like common table expressions, we'll get to these later) require them, otherwise they are optional but considered best practice (I'll almost certainly forget to use them)
- In SQL, white space does not matter

### What are  Relational Database Management Systems?
-  Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs) are software designed to:
  - Store large amounts of data
  - Utilize a query language to allow easy retrieval to the data
  - Allow multiple users to access the data simultaneously
  - Manage permissions for data access
  - Mitigate data corruption and unauthorized access
  
- Generally, data is stored in a _database_
  - a database is a collection of information
  - within a database, a collection of objects (e.g. tabluar data "tables") is stored

- RDBMs software allows its users to define interactions between these objects, such as:
  - Establishing the relationship between objects 
  - Define procedural scripts to query specific data or trigger an action
  - Schedule routine work (e.g. procedures to run, maintenance, etc)

### What is a Data Model?
- A data model is a notation for describing data or information. 

- Data models consist of:
  - Structure of the data
  - Operations that can be done on the data
  - Constraints on the data.

- There are 3 types of data models:
  - Conceptual, high level data models such as Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
  - Relational data models, often in a tabular format  
  - Semi-structured data models such as XML (we won't cover this one)
