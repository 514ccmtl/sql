### What is SQL?

- SQL: Structured Query Language.
  - Pronounced as either S.Q.L. (ess-cue-ell) or “sequel”.
- SQL is a _query_ language rather than a programming language
  - Code is often less reproducible than programming languages because it's domain specific
  - Querying 
- Designed to manage data within Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs), e.g.
  - MSSQL
  - Oracle DB
  - MySQL/MariaDB
  - PostgreSQL

---

# SQL

### SQL Formatting

- Like other programming/query languages, SQL has reserved keywords/commands to perform instructional operations 
  - Generally, these keywords are written in all caps: `SELECT`
  - Most modern interpreters no longer require this, but it is the expected standard
- Similarly, all statements/queries should be ended with a semicolon
  - A few SQL constructs (like common table expressions, we'll get to these later) require them, otherwise they are optional but considered best practice (I'll almost certainly forget to use them)
- In SQL, white space does not matter

## **Flavours**

## Data Modelling

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Flavours
-  RDBMs differ from one to the next. This is manifested in many ways:
    - different keywords 
      - e.g. return only 10 rows:
        `SELECT TOP 10...` vs `SELECT ... LIMIT 10`
    - different syntax
      - e.g. not equal: 
      `!=` or `<>` (or both)
    - other, more nuanced/complex differences
      - e.g. architecture, data types, etc
- We are using SQLite:
  - Super easy to get setup
  - Requires almost no overhead
  - Open source, _free_
  - Similar enough in syntax to learn on

# Data Modelling

### What are  Relational Database Management Systems?
-  Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs) are software designed to:
  - Store large amounts of data
  - Utilize a query language to allow easy retrieval to the data
  - Allow multiple users to access the data simultaneously
  - Manage permissions for data access
  - Mitigate data corruption and unauthorized access
  
- Generally, data is stored in a _database_
  - a database is a collection of information
  - within a database, a collection of objects (e.g. tabular data "tables") is stored

- RDBMs software allows its users to define interactions between these objects, such as:
  - Establishing the relationship between objects 
  - Define procedural scripts to query specific data or trigger an action
  - Schedule routine work (e.g. procedures to run, maintenance, etc)

### What is a Data Model?
- A data model is a notation for describing data or information. 

- Data models consist of:
  - Structure of the data
  - Operations 
  - Constraints on the data
  - Relationships

### Structure of Data

- SQL compromises of tables

| Breed    | Affectionate With Family | Good With Other Dogs | Shedding Level | Coat Type | Coat Length | Playfulness Level | Energy Level |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Pugs     | 5                        | 4                    | 4              | Smooth    | Short       | 5                 | 3            |
| Akitas   | 3                        | 1                    | 3              | Double    | Medium      | 3                 | 4            |
| Samoyeds | 5                        | 3                    | 3              | Double    | Long        | 5                 | 4            |

- Tables have Attributes and Observations
  - In SQL we call Attributes "Columns"
    - e.g. Breed, Coat Type, Coat Length
  - and Observations "Rows"
    - e.g. Samoyed, Double, Long

- SQL databases require tables to be named
  - e.g. We can call this table "breed_traits"

### Structure of Data

- Columns are defined (and restricted) by data types
- Common ones include:
  - INT (integers)
  - FLOAT, DECIMAL<, REAL (decimal)
  - VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, TEXT (text strings, with a maximum length associated)
  - DATE, DATETIME, TIME (date and times)
- These may vary slightly by flavour, (in SQLite they are simpler, and less restricted)
- Data types are important:
  - they affect operation speed, storage size, data validity

### Operations

### Constraints
- Constraints are rules that must be followed

# Data Modelling

### Relationships: Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- ERDs are diagrams depicting the structure of tables within database
  - This both _identifies the tables_ and _describes their relationships_ 
- ERDs are useful for:
  - database design
  - debugging
  - writing logical, consistent, and efficient queries
- There three levels of details for ERD depictions:
  - Conceptual model
  - Logical model
  - Physical model

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Attributes of an ERD Entity
- For a given table:
  - Name
  - Relationship to another table
  - Column Names
  - Column Types
  - Primary Keys (if present)
  - Foreign Keys (if present)

### Attributes of a Relationship
- Defines which columns are related
- Defines what type of relationship exists:
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many


---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Conceptual Models
- Defines the tables (objects/entities) and their relationships

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Logical Models
- Adds additional detail to the conceptual model by adding column names for each table
- Often indicates the type of relationship 
  - One-to-One: where a given row within a table is associated with only a single row in another table
    - Table 1: Country — Table 2: Capital City
  - One-to-Many: where a given row within a table can be referenced by multiple rows in another table
    - Table 1: Customer — Table 2: Customer Orders
  - Many-to-Many: where multiple rows within a table can be referenced by multiple rows in another table
    - Table 1: Employee — Table 2: Employee Type
    - A is both a professor at DSI _and_ a TA at DSI. This means in a table containing both Employee ID and Employee Type ID, A would be listed twice.
    - Even more of a many-to-many because A is part of two courses!

# Data Modelling

### Physical Models
- Adds additional detail to the logical model by adding key type and column data type
  - Primary Key (PK)
    - Ensures each value in a column are unique within the table (e.g. an ID field)
    - One PK per table
    - Cannot be NULL
    - Ensures database integrity by restricting record deletion
  - Foreign Key (FK) 
    - Creates a linkage between a column in one table with a column in another table
      - Generally, foreign keys are linked to primary keys
    - As many FK as needed per table
    - May be NULL
    - Record can be deleted

## Introduction

## **First Three Commands**

---

class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## SELECT

## FROM

## WHERE    

---

class: top, left, inverse
# First Three Commands
- Our first three commands (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) are essential to nearly every SQL query
- The template for our initial SQL statement is as such:

`SELECT` : _the columns we want to retrieve_

`FROM` : _the table we are querying_

`WHERE` : _filters/conditions, (optional)_

`ORDER BY` : _column sorting: ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC), (optional)_

`LIMIT` : _how many rows we want to return, (optional)_

- They always are specified in this order:
  - SELECT will come first
  - FROM will come after SELECT
    - when we are querying more than one table at a time, each will come after FROM but before WHERE (more on this later)
  - WHERE will come after FROM 
  - ORDER BY comes after WHERE clauses
- We'll sometimes use the LIMIT clause to look at data
  - This comes at the very end of a query
  - LIMIT shouldn't be used for analytics unless you have a specific reason
    - ORDER BY often impacts the usefulness of LIMIT 

- One more thing:
  - In SQL, we use two dashes (--) to comment out lines, rather than #
---


class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## **SELECT**

## FROM

## WHERE

---

class: top, left, inverse
# SELECT

- At its simplest SELECT specifies column names we are retrieving
  - commas come between each column name
    - `SELECT student, course, grade ...`
  - column names with a space need to be enclosed in square brackets
    - `SELECT [poorly named column], better_column_name, AnotherColumnName`
- Within SELECT statements we can perform manipulations on columns
  - e.g. rename a column
  - combine two text columns
  - perform math on an numeric column
  - ...and many more things
- When SELECTing columns, they need to exist in the table!
- We can use select to perform math without a FROM statement
  - `SELECT 1 + 1`
  - `SELECT 10*5, cos(2), pi()`

## SELECT

## **FROM**

## WHERE

---

class: top, left, inverse
# FROM

- FROM statements indicate which table the data and where the table is located
  - in more complicated RDBMs, you will often have multiple databases on the same server and multiple schema within those databases
    - a fully qualified location of a table would thus be `database.schema.table`
- `SELECT * FROM table_name` indicates _everything_ in the table
  - best practice suggests that we should explicitly call each column, even if we want all of them 
    - why do we think this is the case?

# FROM

(SELECT & FROM live coding)
---

class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## SELECT 

## FROM

## **WHERE**

---
class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

- WHERE clauses are conditions that the query will follow
- When we have want to have multiple conditions, we use a single WHERE and then additional logical operations
  
  ```
  SELECT *
  FROM students
  WHERE first_name = "Thomas"
  AND last_name = "Rosenthal"
  ```

- WHERE clauses always return rows evaluating to TRUE
  - Follows Boolean rules if more than one condition is present
- My favourite WHERE statement is `WHERE 1=1`
  - Any guesses as to why?
  
---

class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

### Logical Operators
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- IN
- equals: `=`
- does not equal: `<>` `!=`  
  - (flavour dependent)
- greater than (equal to): `>` `>=` 
- less than (equal to)`<` `<=`
- BETWEEN
- EXISTS
  - table specific
- IS
  - NULL specific 
  
--- 

class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

### NULL
- NULL is not a value (it's the absence of a value)
  - to check null values, we use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`
  - `= NULL` will not work
  
### LIKE
- LIKE allows for string wildcards
- `%` specifies the wildcard placement
  - `country_name LIKE 'and%'`
    - Andorra
  - `country_name LIKE '%and'`
    - Finland
    - Iceland ..etc
  - `country_name LIKE '%and%'`
    - all of the above _plus_
    - Antigua and Barbuda
    - Netherlands
    - Rwanda ...more!
  - `country_name LIKE '%an%d%'`
    - Canada ...surely more!
