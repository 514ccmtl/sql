# CASE WHEN
- CASE statements allow us to introduce conditional logic into our SELECT statements
- They are generally similar to `if` or `if else` statements in python, R, and other languages
  - When a condition is introduced, we check whether it evaluates to TRUE
    - If it is true, we proceed with a desired command, calculation, value, etc
      - If it is not true, we move to the next condition
        - If it is true, we proceed with another desired command, calculation, value, etc
          - ...all the way until we run out of conditions
  - For all FALSE conditions, we can use an ELSE statement if we want to
- The results of a CASE statement will be a new column
- Best practice names the new column using `AS new_column_name`

```
CASE 
  WHEN [something is true]
    THEN [value or calculation]
  WHEN [something else is true]
    THEN [value or calcuation]
  ELSE [value or calcuation]
END 
```

# DISTINCT
- Not all query results will result in unique rows (i.e. duplicates are present)
  - Can we think of why this is?

- DISTINCT has two possible spots within a query:
  - One comes immediately after SELECT, before column names are specified
    - `e.g. SELECT DISTINCT songs, albums, artists...`
    - This DISTINCT will govern the entire query
  - The other comes within aggregation
    - e.g. `COUNT(DISTINCT products)`
    - This DISTINCT will only affect this specific aggregation

# JOINs

- Joins are used to combine data stored in different tables into a single table
- Joins are the Cartesian product of two tables with conditional selection of specific rows
  - A Cartesian product combines all possible row values with another 
    - An easy example is a deck of cards:
      
      combining four suits: 
      {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} 
      
      with thirteen ranks:
      {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}
      
      produces 52 cards (4 * 13)
- Joins require relationships (one exception, we'll get to later) between tables
- Different joins create different results
  - Join names specify which conditional selection is desired
- There are three JOIN types in SQL but different joining criteria can further limit results 
- The most permitting join is a FULL OUTER JOIN, the least permitting join is an INNER JOIN
  - Let's explore what this means by looking at each of them

# JOINs

### JOIN Syntax

Syntax for a join is as follows:

```
SELECT [columns]

FROM [left table]
	
JOIN [right table]
	
ON [left table.matching column] = [right table.matching column]
```

A couple of notes:

- You will need to specify which JOIN type is desired:
  - e.g. INNER JOIN
- Matching columns do not need to have the same name, just the same value
  - e.g. `ON table1.LetterGrade = table2.Alphabet` will work because A=A, B=B, C=C, etc
- You can specify more than one column to be joined
  - e.g. `ON table1.FirstName = table2.FirstName AND table1.LastName = table2.LastName`

# INNER JOINs
- INNER JOINs filter both tables to rows present in both tables
- INNER JOINs do not produce `NULL` values
- INNER JOINs are the "default" JOIN
  - i.e. queries do not need to specify "INNER", though it's good practice to write INNER

# INNER JOINs

A quick note on table aliasing:
- It is very common practice to alias table names 
  - It makes JOIN criteria much more concise
  - It simplifies SELECT statements when column names are the same
    - This is a common error, _"ambiguous column name"_
      - SQL requires you to specify _which_ table you are returning the result from
- Generally, tables are aliased with the first letter (or first few letters) of the table so they can be easily referenced
  - `product AS p`
  - `product_category AS pc`

class: top, left, inverse
# LEFT (OUTER) JOINs
- LEFT JOINs filter the "right" table to rows present in the "left" table
- LEFT JOINs will most often produce `NULL` values
- The OUTER in LEFT OUTER JOIN is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded but either are correct
  - LEFT _is not_ optional, there is no "OUTER JOIN"

.center[

All rows from the "left table", and only rows from the 

"right table" with matching values in the specified fields

- RIGHT JOINs filter the "left" table to rows present in the "right" table
- RIGHT JOINs will most often produce `NULL` values
- The OUTER in RIGHT OUTER JOIN is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded but either are correct
- RIGHT JOINs are somewhat frowned upon, but sometimes they make sense
  - Often your query can be reorganized to use a LEFT JOIN instead

---

class: top, left, inverse
# FULL (OUTER) JOINs
- FULL OUTER JOINs do not filter either "left" or "right" table
- Expect `NULL` values to be produced from a FULL OUTER JOIN
- My experience has been to write `FULL OUTER JOIN` rather than `FULL JOIN` but this is personal preference
- Annoyingly, SQLite does not support FULL OUTER JOINS (yet), but there is a work around

### Filtering a FULL (OUTER) JOIN
- All OUTER JOINs can be filtered to exclude the _matching_ criteria
  - Often called an ANTI JOIN, i.e. what's _not_ in the other table

```
SELECT *
FROM table_1
{LEFT | RIGHT | FULL} OUTER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.key = table_2.key
WHERE {table_1.key IS NULL | table_2.key IS NULL | 
       table_1.key IS NULL OR table_2.key IS NULL}
```

# Multiple Table JOINs
- More than one table can be JOINed at a time
- The order and type of JOINs will have significant effect on the final table
  - Pause to imagine what these scenarios might look like based on your knowledge of different JOIN types

For example, let's combine these three tables:

(Table 1)

| FirstName  | Number |
|------------|--------|
| A          | 1      |
| Thomas     | 2      |

(Table 2)

| LastName  | Number |
|-----------|--------|
| Mahfouz   | 1      |
| Rosenthal | 2      |

(Table 3)

| FirstName  | LastName  | Symbol |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| A          | Smith     | !      |
| Edward     | Rosenthal | ?      |

If the desired outcome table is:

| FirstName | LastName  | Number | Symbol |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| A         | Mahfouz   | 1      | !      |
| Thomas    | Rosenthal | 2      | ?      |

What are the correct JOIN criteria?

# GROUP BY
- Aggregations generally require a **group**
- GROUP BY is a mandatory any time a column aside from the one being aggregated is present

For example, a query, wanting to know the number of days in each month:

```
SELECT
COUNT(days)
,months

FROM calendar
GROUP by months
```

- GROUP BY comes after a WHERE clause
- Remember: with all aggregation functions, values will be calculated _per group_

# COUNT
- COUNT performs counts of any given column or sets of columns
- COUNT(*) provides a count of rows in a given table
  - no GROUP BY is required here
- Multiple counts are treated as separate columns
  - e.g. counting the number of days and months in a year
```
SELECT
COUNT(days)
,COUNT(months)
,years

FROM calendar
GROUP by years
```

- When COUNT is combined with DISTINCT, only unique values are counted

### SUM
- SUM performs the sum total of any numeric column
  - Be weary, SQLite may be more permissive for columns with numbers, it's best practice to coerce these values into numbers before summing to be certain of their validity
- SUM can accommodate multiple columns using the plus `+` operator
  - e.g. SUM(column1 + column2)
- Thinking about SUM and COUNT combined (i.e. a rolling total)? We'll get to how to do that in the next session!

### AVG
- AVG performs the average of any numeric column
- Like SUM, it can accommodate multiple columns
  - we can also use other mathematical operations for SUM and AVG, like `-`,`*`,`/`, `%` (i.e. modulo, not percent), etc

- SQL can perform many basic (and some complex) calculations
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, etc
  - geometric/trigonometric functions sin, cos, tan, degrees, radians, etc
  
- These calculations can also be combined inside aggregation functions
  - e.g. multiplication inside a SUM  `...SUM(quantity * cost)` would create a column like total_spent per group
  
- SQL is similar to other programming languages in its ability to handle floating point values
- Because columns are type specific, how would we perform integer division on two numbers?

## **HAVING**

---

class: top, left, inverse
# HAVING
- WHERE clauses filter rows _before_ an aggregation occurs
  
  ...so HAVING clauses allow us to filter rows _after_ an aggregation is calculated
  
- HAVING clauses come after GROUP BY, but before ORDER BY
- HAVING clauses only filter aggregated calculations
  - you can have both WHERE and HAVING
  - they are not interchangeable
