# JOINs

- Joins are used to combine data stored in different tables into a single table
- Joins are the Cartesian product of two tables with conditional selection of specific rows
  - A Cartesian product combines all possible row values with another 
    - An easy example is a deck of cards:
      
      combining four suits: 
      {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} 
      
      with thirteen ranks:
      {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}
      
      produces 52 cards (4 * 13)
- Joins require relationships (one exception, we'll get to later) between tables
- Different joins create different results
  - Join names specify which conditional selection is desired
- There are three JOIN types in SQL but different joining criteria can further limit results 
- The most permitting join is a FULL OUTER JOIN, the least permitting join is an INNER JOIN
  - Let's explore what this means by looking at each of them

# JOINs

### JOIN Syntax

Syntax for a join is as follows:

```
SELECT [columns]

FROM [left table]
	
JOIN [right table]
	
ON [left table.matching column] = [right table.matching column]
```

A couple of notes:

- You will need to specify which JOIN type is desired:
  - e.g. INNER JOIN
- Matching columns do not need to have the same name, just the same value
  - e.g. `ON table1.LetterGrade = table2.Alphabet` will work because A=A, B=B, C=C, etc
- You can specify more than one column to be joined
  - e.g. `ON table1.FirstName = table2.FirstName AND table1.LastName = table2.LastName`

# INNER JOINs
- INNER JOINs filter both tables to rows present in both tables
- INNER JOINs do not produce `NULL` values
- INNER JOINs are the "default" JOIN
  - i.e. queries do not need to specify "INNER", though it's good practice to write INNER

# INNER JOINs

A quick note on table aliasing:
- It is very common practice to alias table names 
  - It makes JOIN criteria much more concise
  - It simplifies SELECT statements when column names are the same
- Generally, tables are aliased with the first letter (or first few letters) of the table so they can be easily referenced
  - `product AS p`
  - `product_category AS pc`

# LEFT (OUTER) JOINs
- LEFT JOINs filter the "right" table to rows present in the "left" table
- LEFT JOINs will most often produce `NULL` values
- The OUTER in LEFT OUTER JOIN is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded but either are correct
  - LEFT _is not_ optional, there is no "OUTER JOIN"

# RIGHT (OUTER) JOINs
- RIGHT JOINs filter the "left" table to rows present in the "right" table
- RIGHT JOINs will most often produce `NULL` values
- The OUTER in RIGHT OUTER JOIN is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded but either are correct
- RIGHT JOINs are somewhat frowned upon, but sometimes they make sense
  - Often your query can be reorganized to use a LEFT JOIN instead

class: top, left, inverse
# FULL (OUTER) JOINs
- FULL OUTER JOINs do not filter either "left" or "right" table
- Expect `NULL` values to be produced from a FULL OUTER JOIN
- My experience has been to write `FULL OUTER JOIN` rather than `FULL JOIN` but this is personal preference

- The order and type of JOINs will have significant effect on the final table
  - Pause to imagine what these scenarios might look like based on your knowledge of different JOIN types

For example, let's combine these three tables:

(Table 1)

| FirstName  | Number |
|------------|--------|
| A          | 1      |
| Thomas     | 2      |

(Table 2)

| LastName  | Number |
|-----------|--------|
| Mahfouz   | 1      |
| Rosenthal | 2      |

(Table 3)

| FirstName  | LastName  | Symbol |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| A          | Smith     | !      |
| Edward     | Rosenthal | ?      |

If the desired outcome table is:

| FirstName | LastName  | Number | Symbol |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| A         | Mahfouz   | 1      | !      |
| Thomas    | Rosenthal | 2      | ?      |

What are the correct JOIN criteria?
