# REGEXP (flavour dependent)
- REGEXP allows for string filtering based on regular expressions (regex)
- Situated within a WHERE clause, very similar to LIKE
- Can use either SQL's or regex's Boolean operators
  - e.g. `WHERE book_title REGEXP '(tion|ice)$'`
  - or   `WHERE book_title REGEXP 'tion$' OR book_title REGEXP 'ice$'`

# UNION & UNION ALL

- UNION and UNION ALL combine the results of two or more queries vertically (rowwise)
- UNION ALL keeps duplicate values, whereas UNION removes them
  - the difference between the two is one of the most common interview questions!
- UNION and UNION ALL require all both queries to have the same number of columns 
  - You can UNION unrelated columns if you had a specific use-case for it
    - Column names will come from the first query
  - In situations where you don't have exactly the same columns, but still need to UNION, you can pass a NULL column
    - Similarly, you can pass a string character to keep which data is associated to which query
  

```
select number_of_tacos, NULL as number_of_burritos, 'lunch' as meal
from lunch
UNION
select  number_of_tacos, number_of_burritos, 'dinner' as meal
from dinner
```

# UNION & UNION ALL

- If we recall back to SQLite's lack of support for FULL OUTER JOINS, UNION ALL will allow us to emulate one:

```
SELECT s1.quantity, s1.costume, s2.quantity
FROM store1 s1
LEFT JOIN store2 s2 ON s1.costume = s2.costume
UNION ALL
SELECT s1.quantity, s2.costume, s2.quantity
FROM store2 s2
LEFT JOIN store1 s1 ON s2.costume = s1.costume
WHERE s1.quantity IS NULL
```

# INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Prior to this, we've focused solely on retrieving values from tables:

- Tables can also be manipulated with INSERT, UPDATE, and/or DELETE
- _A word of warning...these commands are PERMANENT_ `r structure("\U1F631", class = "emoji")`
  - Generally, follow a policy that avoids altering data 
  - Make backups to tables before you run a query
  - Never hurts to test on a temporary table first!
  
- But they are useful, and sometimes the correct solution!
- There is no SELECT statement for these types of queries

# INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### INSERT
- INSERT allows you to add a record
- Specify where you want to add:
  - `INSERT INTO [some_table_name]`
- ...and what you to add:
  - `VALUES(column_one_value, column_two_value)`

- VALUES come in the order of the columns within the tables
- VALUES must respect table constraints
  e.g. NULLs, UNIQUE, data types, etc
  
- INSERT can help you create small helper tables
  - Can you think of any scenarios?

---

### INSERT
- INSERT allows you to change a record
- Specify where you are making your change:
  - `UPDATE [some_table_name]`
- ...and what you to change:
  - `SET column_one = value1, column_one = value2`
- __SPECIFY A WHERE CONDITION__
  - `WHERE condition`

- You can change a single column, a few columns, all the columns, etc
  - (Respecting table constraints)

- What happens if you don't specify a WHERE condition?

---

### DELETE
- DELETE allows you to remove a record
- Specify where you want to delete:
  - `DELETE FROM [some_table_name]`
- __SPECIFY A WHERE CONDITION__
  - `WHERE condition`

- **What happens if you don't specify a WHERE condition?!?**

- DELETE doesn't _remove_ a table from a database
