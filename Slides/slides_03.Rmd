# Subqueries

- SQL allows us to query the results of another query
  - We call this a subquery

--

- Subqueries can be used in both `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses
  - In the case of a `JOIN`:
    - you want the subquery to add columns to your output
    - you are using a subquery because you are joining complex criteria that requires manipulation
      - it is often the case that you are joining two or more tables within a subquery to another table

--

  - In the case of a `WHERE`:
    - you want to filter results 
    - you are using a subquery because it is simpler than joining and filtering the columns otherwise
    - it's important to note: **you can only return a single column** in your subquery

--

- In a subquery, all columns need to be uniquely named
- Subqueries can usually be run for testing purposes by highlighting them, IDE dependent

## CTEs

class: top, left, inverse
# Temporary ("temp") Tables
- Table objects created on the fly
- Automatically saved to a reserved `temp` schema 

--

- Accessible across SQL queries in the same session
- They are cleared from memory when SQL is closed (or the server connection is terminated)

--

- Temporary tables can be chained in the same query
  - You can place one temporary table into another
- Must be dropped (deleted from memory) to recreate them with the same name

--

- Some older versions of SQL don't allow temporary tables
- They are *Fantastic placeholders*
  - **What scenarios can we think of where a temporary table will be particularly useful?**

## **CTEs**

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Common Table Expressions "CTEs"
- Similar to temporary tables
  - CTEs were developed _before_ temp tables
    - some SQL versions/flavours might not support (especially much older ones) temp tables, so CTEs are very important
- Instantiated query results created on the fly
  - utilize the `WITH` command
    - many RDBMs require a semicolon terminating the `WITH` clause
    - multiple CTEs don't use more than one `WITH` clause, but rather follow one another with a comma
  - need to be written _before_ the final `SELECT` statement
  
  
--

- Sometimes easier than a subquery
  - if subqueries become overly complex, they can be harder to read

--

- Stored in memory
- Limited to your current query window only

class: top, left, inverse
# Purpose
- Windowed Functions allow us to create groupings within groupings ("partitions")
- Allow for greater complexity than simple SQL 
  - In Module 2, we mentioned briefly a rolling total, e.g. a SUM and a COUNT, windowed functions allow us to return these types of results
- Often used with a subquery
  - One of the most common techniques is creating a row number (ROW_NUMBER()) per group
    - when combined with ORDER BY, the associated row number will be the _highest_ or _lowest_ per grouping
    - this allows you to select the min or max by setting the row number = 1 in the "outer" (i.e. not the "inner" subquery) query

## Other Windowed Functions

---

class: top, left, inverse
# OVER

- Syntax for windowed function always requires the `OVER` clause
  - `{desired_windowed_function} OVER (ORDER BY [a column])`
- The `ORDER BY` clause is required
- Think of the `OVER` clause as applying the function of your choice
  - e.g. Create row numbers based on the ordering of this column
  - e.g. Rank these values from highest to lowest

## Purpose

## ROW_NUMBER()

## Other Windowed Functions

---

class: top, left, inverse
# PARTITION BY

- Within an `OVER` clause, we can optionally use `PARTITION BY` to create groupings for the function to be applied to
  - `{desired_windowed_function} OVER (PARTITION BY [a column] ORDER BY [a column])`
- Now, the function is being applied to different groups 
  - e.g. Rank these values from highest to lowest within these groups
    - the ranking will restart for each group
    - think of this like the Olympics: the top three competitors for each event get gold, silver, and bronze â€” the `PARTITION BY` is the event, the `ORDER BY` is the time `ASC` or points `DESC` that determine the outcome of the event
- Both the `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` arguments can take more than one column
  - e.g. life expectancy by country by continent

class: top, left, inverse
# ROW_NUMBER()

- `ROW_NUMBER()` is the simplest windowed function, but also one of the most useful
  - There are no mathematical function being applied, just an incremental value by group
  - Determining the "top" (or bottom) per group is often done through `ROW_NUMBER()`

--

- `ROW_NUMBER()` might feel a bit like ranking `RANK()`...but it's not quite
  - **What is the difference between `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()`?**

# Other Windowed Functions
- SQL supports quite a few other windowed functions
- `NTILE` for example will assign rows to buckets (4: quartile, 5: quintile, 10: decile, etc)
  - As such, the `NTILE` function requires an argument passed
    `NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITON BY...ORDER BY...)`
- `LAG` and `LEAD` allow us to create an offset of another column
  - e.g. show a previous_year_total next to a current_year_total for easy comparison
- Knowing how and why to use these can make queries a lot easier

# Formats
- Date formats vary widely in SQL databases
  - A general rule of thumb when working with multiple date fields is to force them all into a similar format 
    - This may seem obvious, but different source systems may write dates different in SQL DBs
- It is not uncommon to store dates values as integers YYYMMDD to increase optimization and decrease storage size
- Manipulating dates varies by flavour
- SQLite is _less_ flexible with dates, requiring all dates to either be:   
  - "YYYY-MM-DD" strings
  - Julian Day fractions
  - Seconds from Unix Time integers

# NOW() (or GETDATE() or DATE, flavour depending)
- These functions (there are actually more of them) get the current date and time
  - Some will return UTC time if requested (this can be useful) e.g. `GETUTCDATE()`
- When combined with other Datetime functions, this can serve as a dynamic value
  - e.g. "yesterday", "last year", and so on
- SQLite uses `DATE()` and `DATETIME()` (without any arguments) _or_ `DATE('now')` _or_ simply `'now'`
  - SQLite's flexibility with single vs double quotes is important here:
    - "now" is the word now
    - 'now' is July 23, 2022

## **ISNULL**

---

class: left, upper, inverse

# ISNULL (and/or COALESCE, flavour depending)
- `ISNULL` allows us to return a replacement value for NULLs
  - Replacement values can be another column, a calculated vale, or static
    - e.g. when col1 is NULL, it is replaced with values from col2
      - values from col2 are only present if col1 is NULL
      - if col2 is NULL, then NULL will be returned
      
- `COALESCE` does this as well, but behaves slightly differently
  - COALESCE allows you to replace NULLs from replacement values themselves
      - e.g. when col1 is NULL, it's replaced with col2; when col2 is NULL, it's replaced with col3, etc
  - `ISNULL` has to be wrapped around `ISNULL` functions in order to mimic this behaviour

- Both are acceptable, `ISNULL` may be faster in some cases, though this isn't totally clear
  - `ISNULL` is also less flexible for mixed data types
