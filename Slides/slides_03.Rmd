# Temporary ("temp") Tables
- Table objects created on the fly
- Automatically saved to a reserved _temp_ schema 
- Accessible across SQL queries in the same session
- They are cleared from memory when SQL is closed (or the server connection is terminated)
- Temporary tables can be chained in the same query
  - You can place one temporary table into another
- Must be dropped (deleted from memory) to recreate them with the same name
- Some older versions of SQL don't allow temporary tables
- They are **Fantastic placeholders**
  - What scenarios can we think of where a temporary table will be particularly useful

# Common Table Expressions "CTEs"
- Similar to temporary tables
  - CTEs were developed _before_ temp tables
- Instantiated query results created on the fly
  - utilize the WITH command
  - 
- Stored in memory
